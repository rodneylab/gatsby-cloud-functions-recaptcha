  Gatsby Cloud Functions reCAPTCHA
</h1>

Example site showing how finished product should look if you follow along my tutorial on using <a href="https://rodneylab.com/gatsby-cloud-functions-recaptcha/">Gatsby Cloud Functions to create a contact form</a>. We use a silent reCAPTCHA, which is more accessible and less annoying than traditional CAPTCHAs. We also use Formik to create an accessible form and nodemailer to send the details to you, using the serverless function.

If you have questions, please drop a comment at the bottom of that page. Hope you find this useful,
